# Dock Persistent Apps
#
# Apps appear in the Dock in this exact order.
# Manual Dock changes WILL BE OVERWRITTEN on rebuild.
#
# App locations:
#   - System apps: /System/Applications/
#   - Nix system packages: /Applications/Nix Apps/
#   - Home Manager apps (copyApps): ~/Applications/Home Manager Apps/
#   - Manual installs: /Applications/
#   - User apps: ~/Applications/
#
# NOTE: TCC-sensitive apps (Ghostty, VS Code, Discord) use copyApps (migrated
# from mac-app-util trampolines) for stable paths that persist macOS TCC
# permissions across darwin-rebuild.
