# Homebrew Configuration
#
# Homebrew is a FALLBACK ONLY for packages not in nixpkgs or severely outdated.
# Prefer nixpkgs for everything - only use homebrew when absolutely necessary.
#
# == Update Philosophy ==
#
# Packages are kept current via `brew autoupdate` (homebrew/autoupdate tap), which
# runs `brew update && brew upgrade --greedy --cleanup` every 30 hours in the
# background via a launchd LaunchAgent. The autoupdate plist is (re)created on
# every `darwin-rebuild switch` via a postActivation script.
#
# Our configuration:
#   - onActivation.autoUpdate = false  → Keeps rebuilds fast (no 45MB index download)
#   - onActivation.upgrade = false     → Rebuilds don't run brew upgrade (autoupdate handles it)
#   - brew autoupdate: every 30h       → Background upgrade with --greedy --cleanup
#   - Passive auto-update: Enabled     → >5 minutes trigger on command invocation
#
# == How Packages Get Updated ==
#
# 1. AUTOMATIC: brew autoupdate runs every 30 hours (background launchd agent)
# 2. MANUAL: Run `brew update && brew upgrade --greedy` for immediate updates
# 3. RENOVATE: Cannot track homebrew versions (no version info in this config)
#
# == Why Renovate Can't Help ==
#
# nix-darwin homebrew config contains only package names, not versions.
# Homebrew lacks declarative version pinning within configuration files.
# Renovate's homebrew manager only works with Ruby Formula files.
#
# NOTE: nix-darwin does NOT support version pinning for individual homebrew packages.
# To prevent upgrades for a specific package, pin it via `brew pin <package>`.
